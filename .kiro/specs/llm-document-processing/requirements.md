# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM Document Processing System is designed to process natural language queries and retrieve relevant information from large unstructured documents such as policy documents, contracts, and emails. The system leverages Large Language Models to understand queries semantically, search through documents intelligently, and provide structured decisions with clear justifications based on document clauses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a claims processor, I want to input natural language queries about insurance claims, so that I can quickly get approval decisions based on policy documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL parse and extract key entities (age, procedure, location, policy duration)
2. WHEN the query contains incomplete information THEN the system SHALL still process the query and indicate missing information in the response
3. WHEN the query is in plain English format THEN the system SHALL understand and process it without requiring structured input
4. WHEN processing a query like "46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy" THEN the system SHALL extract: age=46, gender=male, procedure=knee surgery, location=Pune, policy_age=3 months

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to upload various document formats, so that the system can process different types of policy documents and contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF document THEN the system SHALL extract and process the text content
2. WHEN a user uploads a Word document THEN the system SHALL extract and process the text content
3. WHEN a user uploads email files THEN the system SHALL extract and process the text content
4. WHEN document processing fails THEN the system SHALL return an error message with details about the failure
5. WHEN documents are successfully processed THEN the system SHALL store them in a searchable format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a claims processor, I want the system to find relevant policy clauses using semantic search, so that decisions are based on the most appropriate rules rather than just keyword matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for relevant clauses THEN the system SHALL use semantic understanding rather than simple keyword matching
2. WHEN multiple relevant clauses exist THEN the system SHALL retrieve all applicable clauses ranked by relevance
3. WHEN no exact matches are found THEN the system SHALL return the most semantically similar clauses
4. WHEN clauses conflict with each other THEN the system SHALL identify and flag the conflicts
5. WHEN searching completes THEN the system SHALL return clause text with source document references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a claims processor, I want to receive structured decisions with clear justifications, so that I can understand and audit the system's reasoning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system makes a decision THEN it SHALL return a structured JSON response
2. WHEN returning a decision THEN the response SHALL include: decision status (approved/rejected), amount (if applicable), and detailed justification
3. WHEN providing justification THEN the system SHALL map each decision point to specific clause(s) from source documents
4. WHEN referencing clauses THEN the system SHALL include exact text snippets and document source information
5. WHEN the decision involves calculations THEN the system SHALL show the calculation steps and relevant clause references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to trace every decision back to its source clauses, so that I can audit and verify the system's decision-making process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a decision is made THEN the system SHALL maintain a complete audit trail
2. WHEN providing justification THEN the system SHALL include document name, page/section number, and exact clause text
3. WHEN multiple clauses contribute to a decision THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate how each clause influenced the outcome
4. WHEN decisions are queried later THEN the system SHALL be able to reproduce the same reasoning and references
5. WHEN audit information is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability from query to decision

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want consistent API responses, so that downstream applications can reliably process the system's output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL use a consistent JSON schema
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN processing times vary THEN the system SHALL include processing metadata in responses
4. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN it SHALL return appropriate service status information
5. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the system to handle vague or incomplete queries gracefully, so that I don't need to learn specific query formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query lacks specific details THEN the system SHALL process available information and indicate what's missing
2. WHEN a query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide the best interpretation and suggest clarifications
3. WHEN a query contains typos or informal language THEN the system SHALL still understand the intent
4. WHEN processing incomplete queries THEN the system SHALL return partial results with confidence indicators
5. WHEN queries are too vague to process THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance on what information is needed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a performance monitor, I want the system to process queries efficiently, so that users receive timely responses even with large document sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL return responses within 30 seconds for typical document sets
2. WHEN document sets are large (>1000 pages) THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing and caching strategies
3. WHEN multiple queries are processed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without degradation
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize queries and provide queue status
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and alert administrators
