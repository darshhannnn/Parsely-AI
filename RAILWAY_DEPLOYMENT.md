3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose this repository
6. Railway will auto-detect Python and deploy

**Option B: Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### 3. **Set Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables:

```

LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
```

### 4. **Get Your Webhook URL**
After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
```
https://parsely-ai-production-abc123.up.railway.app
```

Your hackathon webhook URL will be:
```
https://parsely-ai-production-abc123.up.railway.app/hackrx/run
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployment

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
```

### API Test
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/hackrx/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/docs/sample.pdf",
    "questions": ["What is this document about?"]
